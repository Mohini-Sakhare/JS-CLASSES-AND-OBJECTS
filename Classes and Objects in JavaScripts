## Classes and Objects in JavaScript
In JavaScript, classes and objects are basic concepts of Object Oriented Programming (OOPs) that are used to represent real-world concepts and entities.

A class is a template to create objects having similar properties and behavior, or in other words, we can say that a class is a blueprint for objects.
An object is an instance of a class. For example, the animal type Dog is a class, while a particular dog named Tommy is an object of the Dog class.

** JavaScript Classes
A class in JavaScript is a blueprint used to create objects that share similar properties and methods. 
It’s a cleaner, more structured way to implement object-oriented programming compared to the older prototype-based approach.

** The Constructor Method
The constructor method is a special method in JavaScript with the exact name 'constructor.' 
It is automatically executed when a new object is created from a class.
Its primary purpose is to initialize object properties, allowing you to define the initial state of an object during its instantiation.

// define a class
class Dog {
  static sound = "bark"; // class property

  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name; // instance property
  }
}

** JavaScript Class Methods
Defining class methods in JavaScript is easy and simple, we just need to add () following a method name. 

Example:



class Dog {
  constructor(name, breed) {
    this.name = name;   // instance property
    this.breed = breed; // instance property
  }

  // defining method
  bark() {
    console.log(`${this.name} says woof!`);
  }
}

// creating an object (instance)
const myDog = new Dog("Rayne", "Husky");
myDog.bark(); // Output: Rayne says woof!

## Class Getters and Setters
We can use getter and setter methods to get the value of an object and set the value of an object. 
We can use the get keyword for the getter method and the set keyword for the setter methods
